Code Louisville Final Project - January 2016 Front End Class


Project Overview
I created a website for my coffee business, Mid-Town Coffee. Currently, it’s a virtual business, so the site is focused on education. 

Framework
I used bootstrap as the primary framework. I also used Angular to allow me to create one header and one footer template that I could reference across all pages. 

API’s
I used three. 
- Google Maps API - I use it to find coffee shops within 3000 meters of the location that the user clicks on the map

- Tumblr - I have a blog page on the website that brings in the Mid-Town Coffee Tumblr blog

- Twitter - Also on the blog page I have included my personal twitter feed. The feed is constrained to a list container only coffee related accounts.

Other Key Features
PHP Contact Form - I wanted to provide visitors a way to send me a message. I found a pretty cool PHP form that I was able to integrate. 

I found some pretty cool icons as part of the FontAwesome collection. I used these for my Tumblr, Twitter, Email, and Coffee Shop locator icons in the footer. 

Not really a part of the web site, but something that I did to support the PHP form was to launch a web server on my local machine using Apache. Not a big deal to most, but pretty cool to me. 

Coming Soon
A few features that I wanted to add didn’t make it in this sprint. 

- Search engine. I added a search bar, but I currently don’t have anything behind it. I’m afraid I’ll break something this late in the game. But, I found some PHP scripts that do exactly what I want. 

— Content, Content, Content - Not really a part of this effort, but a key to a successful site. I’ll be busy for quite some time.
